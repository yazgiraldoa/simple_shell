## General info
***
Our shell has as prompt "cuchuflí%", Yazmín's trace.

Our shell does what a shell normally does, it opens files with less, creates files with touch, you can modify files with vim, compile programs with gcc, list files and directories with ls, all this along with their flags.
***

## How to install?
***
Installing our Shell is quite easy, go to your terminal, write:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yazgiraldoa/simple_shell.git
```
And it will be installed in minutes!
***
### Plus: how to open it?
Run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
 gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
it will compile the files and then you can execute the hsh program as follows : 
```sh
./hsh
```

## Test cases!

### Interactive mode!

#### ls
```sh
cuchufli% ls ..
holbertonschool-low_level_programming
simple-shell
printf
yazmin

cuchufli% ls -l ..
total 16
drwxrwxr-x 24 yazmin yazmin 4096 ago 18 08:50 holbertonschool-low_level_programming
drwxrwxr-x  6 yazmin yazmin 4096 ago 21 11:04 simple-shell
drwxrwxr-x  3 yazmin yazmin 4096 ago 18 21:30 printf
drwxrwxr-x  3 yazmin yazmin 4096 ago 18 10:07 yazmin
```

#### pwd

```sh
cuchufli% pwd
/home/yazmin/repo/simple-shell
```

#### cat

```sh
cuchufli% cat iacta
Alea iacta est

Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius
(as iacta alea est) to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC
as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step,
he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate and began
his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase has been
adopted in Italian (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile au fost aruncate),
Spanish (La suerte está echada), French (Les dés sont jetés), Portuguese (A
sorte está lançada), Dutch (De teerling is geworpen),
German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van vetve) and many other languages to
indicate that events have passed a point of no return.

```

#### pwd
```sh
yazmin@tp:~/repo/simple-shell$ echo "pwd" | ./hsh
/home/yazmin/repo/simple-shell
```

#### cat
